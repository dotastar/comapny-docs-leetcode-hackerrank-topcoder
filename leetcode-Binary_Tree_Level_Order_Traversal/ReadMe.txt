I
Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example:
Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},
  3
 / \
9  20
  /  \
 15   7
return its level order traversal as:
[
[3],
[9,20],
[15,7]
]
confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.


II
Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

For example:
Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},
  3
 / \
9  20
  /  \
 15   7
return its bottom-up level order traversal as:
[
[15,7]
[9,20],
[3],
]
