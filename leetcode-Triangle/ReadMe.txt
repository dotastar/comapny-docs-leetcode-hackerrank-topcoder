Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.
(The adjacent number of i in this row is i and i+1 in the next row.)

For example, given the following triangle
[
   [2],
  [3,4],
 [6,5,7],
[4,1,8,3]
]
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).

Note:
Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle.
