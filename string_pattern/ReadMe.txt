Write a function in language of your choice that 
takes in two strings, and returns true if they match. 
Constraints are as follows: String 1, the text to match to, 
will be alphabets and digits. String 2, the pattern, will 
be alphabets, digits, '.' and '*'. '.' means either alphabet 
or digit will be considered as a "match". "*" means the 
previous character is repeat 0 or more # of times. For 
example: Text: Facebook Pattern: F.cebo*k returns true.
