Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as 
a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every 
node never differ by more than 1.



Input: {1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,#,#,5,5}

Output: false (based on balanced binary definition "no 2 leaf nodes differ in distance from the root by more than 1")

Expected: true (base on balanced binary definition "two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1" )
