Given a set of n points (coordinate in 2d plane) within 
a rectangular space, find out a line (ax+by=c), from 
which the sum of the perpendicular distances of all 
the points will be minimum. This can has a general usecase 
like, in a village there are few house, you have to lay 
a road, such that sum of all the approach roads from each 
house will be minimum.
