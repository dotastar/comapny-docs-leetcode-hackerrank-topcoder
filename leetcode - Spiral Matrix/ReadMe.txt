I
Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

For example,
Given the following matrix:

[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
You should return [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5].

II
Given an integer n, generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to n^2 in spiral order.

For example,
Given n = 3,

You should return the following matrix:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 8, 9, 4 ],
 [ 7, 6, 5 ]
