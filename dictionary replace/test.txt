Welcome to As It Is, from VOA Learning English! I'm Bob Doughty in Washington.

Today on the program, some nations are attempting to cut links between the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and eastern Congo's mineral exports. Later in the show, we hear what Western governments are doing to avoid fueling the unrest.

But first, researchers recently produced a map of mining areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The map shows mines under the control of the Congolese army and armed groups. The study suggests that the top "conflict mineral" in the area is now gold. Economics reporter Mario Ritter has more on the story.

Gold Increases in Importance as a Conflict Mineral in DRC

A Belgian group, the International Peace Information Service, carried out the study in partnership with the DRC registry of mines.

The researchers found that armed groups were involved in about 200 of the 800 mines they studied. The Congolese army was involved at 265 mines. The researchers reported that both the military and the militias are taxing mine workers illegally.

The International Peace Information Service carried out a similar survey in 2009. Filip Hilgert was the lead researcher. He told VOA the map they made four years ago is no longer correct. He said many of the miners are now digging for gold. And he said the armed groups are profiting much more from gold than from other conflict minerals, such as tin, tungsten and tantalum. These minerals are often called the "3Ts."

One reason for the change has been an increase in the price of gold. Another reason has been stronger international rules for mineral imports. The United States Congress passed legislation to fight the trade of conflict minerals. Mr. Hilgert says such efforts have had a big effect on trade in the 3Ts. But it has not affected the gold trade.

Judith Sargentini is a member of the European Parliament. She has been campaigning for a European law on conflict minerals. She notes that gold, like diamonds, is easy to transport in small amounts. That explains why it is hard to know where it was mined.

The German geological institute BGR has collected minerals from hundreds of mines in Rwanda. The collection could be used to prove whether a sample of minerals came from a conflict area. But, Judith Sargentini suggests that geophysical tests will not work. She says buyers need to know about their suppliers.

"You cannot solve every trade in commodity by trying to find out what the geological background of a material is. It shows that you need, first of all, a due diligence supply chain, and second of all, initiatives that lead to fair trade gold mining."

Due diligence, in this case, means knowing and being able to trust your supplier.

Western Nations Act Against Conflict Minerals

Western governments want to cut links between the conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and the area's mineral exports.

Both the United States and the European Union have taken steps to tighten control of mineral imports to avoid fueling the conflict in eastern Congo. Mario Ritter has more.

The United States Congress passed the Dodd Frank Act in 2010. The law deals mainly with financial rules. But it also includes a special requirement for American-listed companies. It says buyers of tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold need to show they have not supported conflict in Africa's Great Lakes area.

Now the European Union is also writing a bill to prevent deals that help private armies in the eastern Congo. Judith Sargentini says the aim of the European law is to help break the link between the minerals trade and armed conflict. She suggests the law will require EU companies buying minerals to prove they were mined without supporting the conflict in the Congo.

"We cannot just have the U.S. work on the issue, where we are the bigger trading countries with Africa and ignore this. It will influence European companies that want to trade on the U.S. market, but besides that, more importantly, Europe has a responsibility towards a lot of countries that are actually even former colonies."

She says the bill is not a reaction to an increase in Chinese imports of these minerals by companies that are not concerned about the Dodd Frank Act.

"But I would say that European communication on trade and raw materials, of course, is completely influenced by the fear that Europe has that China will buy out everything and we don't have anything in the future anymore"

Judith Sargentini says the American law reduced trade and jobs. She notes that the proposed law will not stop imports from eastern Congo. She says some imports will continue even if the minerals were mined under what she called bad circumstances.

Critics say the Dodd Frank Act stopped trade and led to the illegal transport of minerals through nearby countries. Ms. Sargentini agrees but says the planned law should have a different effect. She says the EU trade commissioner wants to increase trade with the Congo. She says the law will reward businesses that make an effort to trade minerals fairly and openly.

Some Congolese experts say they think the Dodd Frank Act has helped to cut the flow of money to militia leaders. In eastern Congo, workers at the Enough Project say people have changed behaviors because of it, but the conflict minerals part of the law has yet to be enforced.

And that is As It Is. I'm Bob Doughty. Be listening again tomorrow for another program from VOA Learning English.

IN THE NEWS - UN Chief Wants 3,000 Troops Sent to Central African Republic

From VOA Learning English, this is In the News.

United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has appealed for international action to stop religious violence in the Central African Republic. Mr. Ban asked the Security Council on Thursday to deploy at least 3,000 more troops to the country within the coming days and weeks. He said, "When innocent civilians are being murdered in large numbers, deliberately targeted in the most brutal fashion, simply because of who they are, the world must act."

More than 7,000 African Union and French forces are already in the country. The European Union has promised to send another 1,000 soldiers. The Central African Republic is a former French colony.

This week, Mr. Ban also proposed $38 million in financial and other aid for the AU forces. He worries the religious violence could turn into genocide. The unrest began a year ago after Muslim rebels ousted the president, Francois Bozize. His overthrow and resulting violence led to a majority Christian militia. Its members are accused of carrying out attacks against Muslim civilians. Since December, hundreds of people have died in clashes between Muslims and Christians. Tens of thousands have fled the country in the past month.

The militia men call themselves the anti-balaka. Balaka is said to be a word for knife or machete in a local language. Militia members say they came to the capital, Bangui, in December to oust the government of Michel Djotodia, the country's first Muslim president. But international forces have accused the anti-balaka of being the problem. They say its fighters are increasingly turning to attacking homes and businesses.

Some fighters are only teenagers. They have set up roadblocks on country roads, carrying weapons and demanding money. French and African troops have used force to disarm them.

The anti-balaka has been described as a loose alliance, and several leaders claim to speak for the men. Joachim Kokate represented the militia at a meeting in January. He says it is time for justice. He says those organizing theft and extrajudicial killings should be targeted, and they should answer for their acts.

Many anti-balaka fighters tell VOA they want the same treatment the Muslim Seleka rebels are receiving. That means they want food, shelter and financial aid. They also want the chance to join the national army as part of a disarmament agreement.

Some fighters consider themselves liberators of their country. Others see the conflict as becoming a battle between religious groups. But the militias are made up of both Christians and animists, people who believe that natural objects have spirits. They say they are motivated by nationalism -- not religion.

Anti-balaka leaders say they have tens of thousands of fighters.

AS IT IS - Syrian Refugees in Lebanon Lack Food Aid and Education

From VOA Learning English, this is As It Is.

Welcome back. I'm Caty Weaver. On the program today we explore the situation of almost one million Syrian refugees currently living in Lebanon. More and more flee across the border every day. The United Nations is concerned about the limited food aid it can provide the refugees. And it says most refugee children are receiving little or no education.

The Syrian refugee crisis in Lebanon: today on As It Is.

Many Syrian Refugees in Lebanon Lose Food Aid

United Nations agencies have been forced to reduce food aid to about one out of five Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Those who get no food say they are falling into deep debt. VOA reporter Jamie Detmer investigated the situation from Beirut. Christopher Cruise has his report.

Syrian refugees continue to flee the violence in their country. Many of them are going to Lebanon. U.N. aid agencies found it increasingly difficult to provide food assistance to them for most of last year. Twenty percent of registered refugees had their food aid ended at the end of 2013.

Um-Odai fled the Syrian city of Homs with her husband and five children. They are living in a shelter in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli.

She says her family stopped receiving assistance, and now, they owe a lot of money. Her husband is too sick to look for work. Four of her children are very young. Her oldest son has a wife and a newborn.

She says one of her sons works as a laborer on jobs that sometimes last for just one day. When he finds a job he can bring money to the family. But Um-Odai says the family owes money to many shops in the area. They do not know how they will pay their debt.

She says they owe $2,000 after living in Lebanon for a year-and-half.

About eleven thousand Syrian refugees arrive in Lebanon every week. Negotiators have made little progress in reaching an agreement to end the civil war in Syria. The flow of Syrian refugees to Lebanon shows no sign of slowing. A million Syrians will have registered as refugees in Lebanon by the beginning of March if new arrivals continue at the current rate.

Ninette Kelley is the head of the U.N. refugee agency in Lebanon. She says the U.N. does not have enough food for all of the refugees, so it helps those most at risk.

"Most of last year, blanket food assistance was provided to everybody who was registered, but this is not something that is a normal practice. But once you have more information you can further target your provision of food assistance according to vulnerability."

Last year, U.N. agencies worked to establish who were the most at risk among all registered Syrian refugees. The agencies found 80 percent of the refugees would have no other form of food support without international assistance. The agencies used this information to make some difficult decisions.

"Which meant that there were 20 percent who had been receiving food who were notified that they would no longer receive it on a regular basis."

But Um-Odai says she does not understand why she and her family are among about 250,000 refugees without food assistance. She says the decision does not seem reasonable. She says she and her husband know other refugees in the camp who are in the same situation as they are. But, she says, those refugees are still receiving U.N. money to buy food and her family is not.

Even those who receive U.N. food aid say life is getting harder and more costly. They say they, too, are creating debt.

I'm Christopher Cruise.

United Nations officials say one-third of the Syrian refugees fleeing to Lebanon are school-age children. But the majority of them are not able to go to school. We return to Caty Weaver, who has more on the situation of these young refugees.

Many Syrian Refugee Children Not Attending School

Eleven-year-old Marah has been in Lebanon for eighteen months. She lives in an unofficial refugee settlement near the coastal Lebanese city of Tripoli. Her family had lived on a farm near the Syrian city of Homs. They fled when a rocket hit their farmhouse during an attack.

Marah is luckier than most of the refugee children in Lebanon: she is attending school.

Marah says it is difficult for her to learn in Lebanon's French-based educational program. In Syria, she was taught in Arabic. She says she speaks Lebanese to understand the other students. But there are problems. She says they sometimes insult her and other Syrian students for being refugees.

But Marah at least has a chance of reaching her goal to become a nurse. In her settlement there are about 200 families. Only a few of them have children in school.

Media reports about the refugees are mostly about their emergency needs -- like food and medical care. Those needs take most of the humanitarian aid as well. But the longer-term needs of the refugees are becoming more central as the Syrian civil war continues.

The lack of educational possibilities for refugee children is a major concern for Ninette Kelley.

"The situation of children is rather dire. There are over 300,000 new Syrian school-age children, which is the same number of Lebanese children who were registered at Lebanese schools last year. And while the ministry of education has indicated they could absorb 100,000 in the formal education system that still leaves over 200,000 without a formal education option."

The U.N. and non-governmental groups are working together to try to provide basic reading and writing classes for children. It is centering efforts on the temporary refugee settlements that are being created. The Lebanese government has refused permission for the building of official refugee camps.

But, Ms. Kelley says basic reading and writing classes are not going to meet the needs of older children in the camps.

And that's As It Is for today. I'm Caty Weaver. Thanks for joining us.
